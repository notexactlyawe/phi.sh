Old fishermen could be paid to classify
Should be in video mode
 - clean hands
Robust
Find environment
We should find ways of increasing engagement and usage
 - ie incentives
 - provide sim cards

Reqs
----
< 5s classify
classify in background
Withstands sea
Lack of user input
Manual classification/proper server machine learning

Implementation
--------------
App using opencv
Background service to capture metrics such as location
Main app that records fish when put into mode
 - after record finished, produces 'trouble fish'
Record measures length, breadth, species, (weight from metric, pitch makes hardware hard)
Login of some kind that links user to some metadata about equipment etc

Tasks
-----
Service bit (location tracking etc (background))
Database
Server version of client functionality
Web crowd classification with voting mechanism
Visualisations
Main app
 - Save to disk (persistence)
    - Before upload
 - Video/camera bit
 - Classify activity
    - if cannot auto, get user input
 - OpenCV bit

Phone call with Harry Owen - MCB Seafoods - expert

Size of vessel changes thing
Smaller have nets on deck everything open
Bigger can be enclosed completely
Fish in penned off area
SORTED BY HAND
Conveyor belts on fish
Flood pen
Conveyor picks them up (like water wheel)

Smartphone depends (huge variation)
Lots don't have email/smartphones
Possible to convince them

Difficult to sex fish
Some are dimorphic (some aren't, require training)
Not important, useful for only targeting males
Fewer males necessary

Lots of slime on fish

Old fishermen depends
Lots of money in leadline/parts of net
"Cuttting out", "Rehanging"
Fishermen fish until unable to continue
Probably still able to use an app
